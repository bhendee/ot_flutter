# Optimality Theory Flutter
This is a little WIP tool to handle Tableaux and solving them in various forms of Optimality Theory.

Optimality Theory is a theory used in Phonology, a field of Linguistics.

This app aims to replicate the functionality of a highly dated Java app, OTHelp, with some more modern comforts.
Documentation of Tableaux tab-separated formatting is available for OTHelp elsewhere and works here.

One of the major foci is in-app editing of tableaux, because the tab-separated format is clumsy to edit directly.

Currently this hardly works so don't get your hopes up.
